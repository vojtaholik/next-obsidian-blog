A **laminar flow cabinet** or **tissue culture hood** is a carefully enclosed bench designed to prevent contamination of biological samples, semiconductor wafers, or any particle sensitive materials. In a [biosafety cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_cabinet "Biosafety cabinet") version air is drawn through a [HEPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA "HEPA") filter and blown in a very smooth [laminar flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow "Laminar flow") in a narrow vertical curtain, separating the interior of the cabinet from the environment around it. The cabinet is usually made of [stainless steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel "Stainless steel") with no gaps or joints where spores might collect.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow_cabinet#cite_note-1)
