***Video 3:** Pretty cool stuff! I took the Ubiquitin protein and progressively introduced
genetic mutations by inserting random tri-nucleotide repeat. Each mutagenesis cycle was then
processed by Alpha Fold model.*

***Video 4:** Molecular dynamics simulation of interaction between the antigen-binding region from the monoclonal 
anti-lysozome antibody and the antigen, hen egg white lysozome.*

***Video 5:** My first successful molecular simulation of a protein folding using Gaisteger solver (that is also considering hydrogen bonding)
protein used: AF-P60995-F1 (e-coli) short peptide seq*
