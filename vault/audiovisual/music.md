# field recorded ambiances

**SoundCloud:** This was probably the style that used to suit me the most. It involved me finding interesting real-world places to record and then incorporating dub-like ambiances processed throught old tape machines to intensify the mood.

# dub techno

**SoundCloud:** Making analog and noisy dub techno tracks were also my favourite for a long time!

# beats & drums

<iframe width="100%" height="100" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/458958423&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe>

**SoundCloud:** Another part of music story for me was making beats in odd time signatures and incorporating more oddly colored tonal scales. This track features 5/4 rhythm with quartal harmonies.

**Video:** For a long time I was passionate about african music theory, this is my favourite polyrhytmic composition based around Takada rhythmic patterns from Ghana region.

# Optical Frameworks

_Video: Track 'One Session' recorded in industrial SVIT zone in Zlin. All sounds are processed field recordings only._

**Video:** Last Autumn by Optical Frameworks

**Optical Frameworks** was an ambient-drone-dub-field-recording project of mine based on fiddling around with **lo-fi analog** devices at hand such as multi-head tape recorders, DIY hydrophones and contact microphones, blending with processed layers of field-recordings I took during my travels. I had released six albums on the Lithuanian label **ColdTear Records**.
